* Structure of the geometry description

The geometry is divided into several files to make working with it easier.
- [[./detector.gdml]] This is the entrypoint of the geometry. Contains the actual implementation of the prototype geometry using the definitions from [[./absorber_volume.gdml]] and [[./scintillator_volume.gdml]]
- [[./constants.gdml]] Contains variable definitions used elsewhere in the
  geometry such as positions and geometrical properties of different volumes.
- [[./materials.gdml]] Contains definitions of isotopes and materials
- [[./userinfo.gdml]] Contains auxillary information (see the
  [[https://gdml.web.cern.ch/GDML/doc/GDMLmanual.pdf][GDML manual]] for
  details), such as sensitive detector volumes, visualization information,
  version and author information.
- [[./hcal_solids.gdml]] Contains definitions of the absorber, scintillator, and parent boxes
- [[./absorber_volume.gdml]] Contains the definition of the absorber volume
- [[./scintillator_volume.gdml]] Contains the definition of the scintillator volumes
